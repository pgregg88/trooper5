# High-level Plan

1. Run locally on a rpi5 with high-speed SSD storage rather than sd-card
2. Use the OpenAI: Realtime API Agent Demo as the base code for the project.
3. Establish a defined game concept, backstory examples and associated game logic we’ll use to define requirements for our game rules and stormtrooper agent configurations.
4. Always follow KISS principles, starting with simple game logic, rules and agent modes to get an MVP established quickly, then expand through careful, incremental iterations to expand functionality.
5. Use the provided OpenAI agent examples to establish the new stormtrooper agent modes that are appropriate for our defined game concept and logic, remembering our KISS principles at all times. 
6. Voice responses are returned from the OpenAI Realtime API using WebRTC. Each returned audio file be transformed by a local effects pipeline to modify the voice to sound like a real stormtrooper before being played on a local speaker.
7. Over time we’ll add additional inputs like motion detection and face recognition to trigger interactions, etc.
